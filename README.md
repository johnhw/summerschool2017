### Purpose
  The purpose of these notes is to get hands on experience in applying Bayesian, probabilistic models to HCI. The focus is on specific, practical examples rather than theory.    
### Outline

These notes  cover **two topics**, with a mix of practical and lecture material.
1. [Static models: Inferring Typing Behaviour](static/mcmc_typing.ipynb) This section looks at building probabilistic Bayesian models of typing behaviour, and inferring parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo    

1. Dynamic models: [Tracking Cursors](dynamic/kalman_filter.ipynb) and [Recognising gestures](dynamic/particle_gesture.ipynb) This section looks at building dynamic probabilistic models that can track states over time, including estimating cursor movement with noisy, partial measurements and spotting and tracking gestures.
